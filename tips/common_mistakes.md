Buying photography cameras.

As of picture quality, most cameras for YouTube videos are not born for videos, but photography. Therefore, many specs are useless for videography such as megapixels (for 4K resoltuion, 8 million pixels are enough), EVF, continuous shooting, and etc. Don't waste money for that. A good YouTube camera (especially for vlogs) requires fully articulated screen, good image stabilization, good sound quality (can be done with external mic), and lightweight (you arms won't shake and can hold to talk at least 30 seconds comfortably).
